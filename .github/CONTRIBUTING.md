## Where to ask Questions?

Questions can be asked in form of discussion in ACME repository.

## Should I fork this repository to contribute or ask for permissions to commit direct over the repository?
  
## What should I know before I get started?

### Package Conventions

There are a few conventions that have developed over time around packages:

### Design Decisions

[Link your design decision if you want]

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for XXXX. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Suggesting Enhancements

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to ACME? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

#### Local development

All packages can be developed locally. For instructions on how to do this, see the following the README.md [LINK].

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain ACME's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible ACME
- Enable a sustainable system for ACME's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
